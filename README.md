The changelog does not cover every commit.  It outlines highlights and
significant changes.

Quality note: In late 2014, I found this repository on my hard drive from 2011.
I'm surprised and don't remember why I never uploaded this to Hackage.  As a
relatively inexperienced 16-year-old with at most 2 years of functional
programming experience (with much more procedural programming experience), I
wrote Haskell code in a way that I now expect to be capable of rewriting with
something of much better quality.  But I was pleasantly surprised with the
quality of the documentation, taking into account my memory of my past self.
Quality-wise, it seems better than a few other projects I wrote at around the
same time, e.g. `monad-state`, although that was 6-12 months earlier.

I've since converted the repository to git and uploaded it to github.  I've
patched it up so that it builds, but nothing more yet (sans a few minor
cleanups here and there, largely just in the cabal file, that I'm applying to
each of my old projects I found).

Contributions, feedback, and constructive criticism are welcome.
